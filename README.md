# learning-c
These are all of my source files for following along with @h0mbre's learning-c repo. Not a software dev - code may be messy.

I'll also include my files for K&R's assignments, since I have that lying around and need to read through it since I'm a beginner. I'll prefix those with kAndR_assignment_<#>.
